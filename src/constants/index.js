export const ABOUT_TEXT = ` I am currently a software engineer and an entrepreneur. 
I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin and got a associates degree in computer science. 

Still deciding whether I want to pursue a bachelors or not. 

As mentioned I am sort of new to the whole entrepreneurship thing. 

I have been working on a marketing agency that offers high-converting copywriting and sales funnels to both info and coaching businesses. 

In the future I am looking to create a software business and then enventually create an energy drink business, because most of the energy drinks I have tried always have 1 of two problems : 

1. They always make me crash or 

2. The ingredients are garbage.  `;
