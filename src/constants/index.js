I enjoy learning about pretty much anything - sales, marketing, finance, programming, business, entrepreneurship, etc. I am currently working on a marketing agency called 1'st Marketing where we offer high-converting copywriting and sales funnels to both info and coaching businesses. In the future I am looking to create a software business and then enventually create an energy drink business, because most of the energy drinks I have tried always have 1 of 2 problems : 1. They make me crash or 2. The ingredients are fucking garbage.  `;
