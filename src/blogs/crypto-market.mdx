My view on the current crypto economy can be summed up in one word:

**confused**

why?

Because this is what happens when public authority realizes what power they hold and the damage they can do - large corporations buying tremendous amounts of crypto, causing lots of public investors to give into the FOMO they think they have and then when the price goes from a lower lower to a lower high - these large corporations just sell the profits.

Although I don't really care because crypto is every man for himself, it's such a shame seeing what this economy has - is heading towards. Watching the U.S president drop a coin - followed by multiple countries just to rug pull everyone is truly a sad thing to see.

On the bright side - I personally think this is just the start of the bullrun - although bitcoin has broken ATH I think we are bound to see a 150k BTC by the end of the year. However that does not go without saying that it's going to be sunshine and rainbows - I think the market will continue to bleed through March and possibly April.

Going back to my main point as to why I am confused - I sometimes ask myself how did it get this bad - just the amount of rug pulls on Solana and influencer scams. I guess it has been going on for a while - but it's really interesting to be alive during this time.

Personally I am holding only a couple of tokens this cycle including XRP, ETH, BRETT, RNDR and will possibly get back into some others I was holding like KAS and DOGE.
